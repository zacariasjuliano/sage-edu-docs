## 📘 Development Process

**SAGE Education** follows a structured development cycle, ensuring quality, security and stability with each new version. Stable releases are made available annually (every 12 months). Among these releases, the following are distributed:

* Quarterly updates (every 3 months), bringing improvements, optimizations and small features.

* Monthly security updates, which ensure the integrity, protection, and usability of the system, are released on the 12th day.


### 🔄 Launch Process Steps

The process of releasing a new stable version is carefully coordinated:

* 1. Feature Freeze
Approximately two months before the release of the stable version, new features are no longer added. The focus becomes stabilization, testing and bug fixes.

* 2. Code Freeze
About a month before release, the code freeze period enters, in which only critical fixes are allowed. At this stage, the release candidate (RC) is generated.

* 3. Update of Environments and Communication to Teams
With the RC available, the [demo community server](https://sage.comunidadedosaber.ao) is updated, allowing users and partners to validate the new version. Documentation, support and integration teams are also notified to begin their adaptation processes.

* 4. Stable Version Release
After validation, final tests and necessary adjustments, the stable version is officially available.


### 📦 Stable Version

The current stable version of **SAGE Education** is 1.1.0, developed on the basis of Trytond 6.8.14.

The expected dates for the next versions will be announced according to the community's progress and may change.
